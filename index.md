The Active Directory Management Framework (ADMF) provides a powerful engine to manage Active Directory using configuration.

Gone are the days, where you need to actually write script-code to define how your active directory environment should look like!
Using freely combinable configuration sets, you can define your desired state in configuration files, then deploy, validate and remediate your existing environments.
